# sev

The `sev` crate provides an implementation of [AMD Secure Encrypted
Virtualization (SEV)](https://developer.amd.com/sev/) APIs.

The Linux kernel exposes two technically distinct AMD SEV APIs:

1. An API for managing the SEV platform itself
2. An API for managing SEV-enabled KVM virtual machines

This crate implements both of those APIs and offers them to client
code through a flexible and type-safe high level interface.

### Platform Management

Refer to the [`firmware`] module for more information.

### Guest Management

Refer to the [`launch`] module for more information.

### Remarks

Note that the Linux kernel provides access to these APIs through a set
of `ioctl`s that are meant to be called on device nodes (`/dev/kvm` and
`/dev/sev`, to be specific). As a result, these `ioctl`s form the substrate
of the `sev` crate. Binaries that result from consumers of this crate are
expected to run as a process with the necessary privileges to interact
with the device nodes.

### Using the C API

Projects in C can take advantage of the C API for the SEV [`launch`] ioctls.
To install the C API, users can use `cargo-c` with the features they would
like to produce and install a `pkg-config` file, a static library, a dynamic
library, and a C header:

`cargo cinstall --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64`

[`launch`]: ./src/launch/
